{{< include-headless "tagline.md" >}}
{{< product >}} started as a fork, branched after syslog-ng&trade; v4.7.1 with the following focus:

- Cloud native:
    - Provides containers, Helm charts, Kubernetes integration, ARM support
- Parsing and transformation tailored for security data ([FilterX]({{< relref "/filterx/_index.md" >}}), app-parser, app-transform)
- Performance (eBPF support, alternative memory allocator, and so on),

{{< product >}} (created by the original creators of `syslog-ng`):

- is a drop in replacement for `syslog-ng`,
- keeps using the same license and development practices.
