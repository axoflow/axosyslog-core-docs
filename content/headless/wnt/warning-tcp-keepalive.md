The `tcp-keepalive-time()`, `tcp-keepalive-probes()`, and `tcp-keepalive-intvl()` options only work on platforms which support the `TCP_KEEPCNT`, `TCP_KEEPIDLE`,and `TCP_KEEPINTVL` setsockopts. Currently, this is Linux.

A connection that has no traffic is closed after `tcp-keepalive-time() + tcp-keepalive-intvl() \* tcp-keepalive-probes()` seconds.
