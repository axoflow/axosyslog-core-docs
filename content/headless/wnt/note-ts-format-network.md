This option applies only to file and file-like destinations. Destinations that use specific protocols (for example, `network()`, or `syslog()`) ignore this option. For protocol-like destinations, use a template locally in the destination, or use the [proto-template]({{< relref "/docs/chapter-global-options/reference-options/_index.md" >}}) option.
