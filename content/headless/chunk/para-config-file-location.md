To configure {{% param "product.abbrev" %}}, edit the `syslog-ng.conf` file with any regular text editor application. The location of the configuration file depends on how you installed {{% param "product.abbrev" %}}. Native packages of a platform (like the ones downloaded from Linux repositories) typically place the configuration file under the `/etc/syslog-ng/` directory.
