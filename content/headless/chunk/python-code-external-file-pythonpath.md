If you store the Python code in a separate Python file and only include it in the {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} configuration file, make sure that the PYTHONPATH environment variable includes the path to the Python file, and export the PYTHON_PATH environment variable. For example, if you start {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} manually from a terminal and you store your Python files in the `/opt/syslog-ng/etc` directory, use the following command: `export PYTHONPATH=/opt/syslog-ng/etc`.

In production, when {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} starts on boot, you must configure your startup script to include the Python path. The exact method depends on your operating system. For recent Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, and CentOS distributions that use systemd, the `systemctl` command sources the `/etc/sysconfig/syslog-ng` file before starting {{% param "product.abbrev" %}}. (On openSUSE and SLES, `/etc/sysconfig/syslog` file.) Append the following line to the end of this file: `PYTHONPATH="<path-to-your-python-file>"`, for example, `PYTHONPATH="/opt/syslog-ng/etc"`.
