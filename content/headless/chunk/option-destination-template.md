## template()

| Type:    | string                                             |
| Default: | A format conforming to the default logfile format. |

*Description:* Specifies a template defining the logformat to be used in the destination. Macros are described in {{% xref "/docs/chapter-manipulating-messages/customizing-message-format/reference-macros/_index.md" %}}. Please note that for network destinations it might not be appropriate to change the template as it changes the on-wire format of the syslog protocol which might not be tolerated by stock syslog receivers (like `syslogd` or syslog-ng itself). For network destinations make sure the receiver can cope with the custom format defined.
