For untrusted certificates only the existence of the certificate is checked, but it does not have to be valid â€” `syslog-ng` accepts the certificate even if it is expired, signed by an unknown CA, or its CN and the name of the machine mismatches.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

When validating a certificate, the entire certificate chain must be valid, including the CA certificate. If any certificate of the chain is invalid, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} will reject the connection.
