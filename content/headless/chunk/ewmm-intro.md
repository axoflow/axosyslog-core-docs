The [Enterprise-wide message model or EWMM]({{< relref "/docs/chapter-concepts/concepts-message-structure/syslog-ng-message-format/_index.md" >}}) allows you to deliver structured messages from the initial receiving AxoSyslog component right up to the central log server, through any number of hops. It does not matter if you parse the messages on the client, on a relay, or on the central server, their structured results will be available where you store the messages. Optionally, you can also forward the original raw message as the first AxoSyslog component in your infrastructure has received it, which is important if you want to forward a message for example, to a SIEM system. To make use of the enterprise-wide message model, you have to use the [`syslog-ng()` destination on the sender side]({{< relref "/docs/chapter-destinations/destination-syslog-ng/_index.md" >}}), and the [`default-network-drivers()` source on the receiver side]({{< relref "/docs/chapter-sources/source-default-network-drivers/_index.md" >}}).
