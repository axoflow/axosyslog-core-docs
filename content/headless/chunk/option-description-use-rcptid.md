*Description:* When the `use-rcptid` global option is set to **yes**, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} automatically assigns a unique reception ID to every received message. You can access this ID and use it in templates via the `${RCPTID}` macro. The reception ID is a monotonously increasing 48-bit integer number, that can never be zero (if the counter overflows, it restarts with 1).
