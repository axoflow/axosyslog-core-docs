To import a certificate into a Java keystore, use the appropriate tool of your Java implementation. For example, on Oracle Java, you can use the `keytool` utility:

```c
   keytool -import -alias ca -file <certificate-to-import> -keystore <keystore-to-import> -storepass <password-to-the-keystore>

```
