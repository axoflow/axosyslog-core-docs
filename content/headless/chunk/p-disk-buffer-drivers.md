The following destination drivers can use the disk-buffer option: `amqp()`, `elasticsearch2()`, `file()`, `hdfs()`, `http()`, `kafka()`, `mongodb()`, `program()`, `redis()`, `riemann()`, `smtp()`, `sql()`, `stomp()`, `unix-dgram()`, and `unix-stream()`. The `network()`, `syslog()`, `tcp()`, and `tcp6()` destination drivers can also use the disk-buffer option, except when using the `udp` transport method. (The other destinations or protocols do not provide the necessary feedback mechanisms required for the disk-buffer option.)
