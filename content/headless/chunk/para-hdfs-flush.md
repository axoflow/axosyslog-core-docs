You cannot set when log messages are flushed. Hadoop performs this action automatically, depending on its configured block size, and the amount of data received. There is no way for the {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} application to influence when the messages are actually written to disk. This means that {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} cannot guarantee that a message sent to HDFS is actually written to disk. When using flow-control, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} acknowledges a message as written to disk when it passes the message to the HDFS client. This method is as reliable as your HDFS environment.
