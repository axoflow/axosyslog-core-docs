The `ewmm-parser()` can be used to parse messages sent by another `syslog-ng` host using the enterprise-wide message model (EWMM) format. Available in version 3.16 and later. Note that usually you do not have to use this parser directly, because the [default-network-drivers() source]({{< relref "/docs/chapter-sources/source-default-network-drivers/_index.md" >}}) automatically parses such messages.


## Declaration:

```c
   parser parser_name {
        ewmm-parser();
    };
```
