To simplify the building of pattern databases, {{% param "product.companyabbrev" %}} has released (and will continue to release) sample databases. You can download sample pattern databases from the [{{% param "product.companyabbrev" %}} GitHub page](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng-patterndb/) (older samples are temporarily available [here](https://my.balabit.com/downloads/patterndb-snapshot/)).

Note that these pattern databases are only samples and experimental databases. They are not officially supported, and may or may not work in your environment.

The syslog-ng pattern databases are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (CC by-SA) license. This includes every pattern database written by community contributors or the {{% param "product.companyabbrev" %}} staff. It means that:

  - You are free to use and modify the patterns for your needs.

  - If you redistribute the pattern databases, you must distribute your modifications under the same license.

  - If you redistribute the pattern databases, you must make it obvious that the source of the original syslog-ng pattern databases is the [{{% param "product.companyabbrev" %}} GitHub page](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng-patterndb/).

If you create patterns that are not available in the GitHub repository, consider sharing them with us and the syslog-ng community. To do this, open a GitHub issue, or send them to the [syslog-ng mailing list](https://lists.balabit.hu/mailman/listinfo/syslog-ng/).
