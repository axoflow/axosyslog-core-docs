By default, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} parses every message using the `syslog-parser` as a syslog message, and fills the macros with values of the message. The `syslog-parser` does not discard messages: the message cannot be parsed as a syslog message, the entire message (including its header) is stored in the $MSG macro. If you do not want to parse the message as a syslog message, use the `flags(no-parse)` option of the source.

You can also use the `syslog-parser` to explicitly parse a message, or a part of a message as a syslog message (for example, after rewriting the beginning of a message that does not comply with the syslog standards).

Note that by default, the `syslog-parser` attempts to parse the message as an RFC3164-formatted (BSD-syslog) message. To parse the message as an RFC5424-formatted message, use the `flags(syslog-protocol)` option in the parser.

```c
   syslog-parser(flags(syslog-protocol));
```
