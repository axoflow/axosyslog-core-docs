The AxoSyslog application is not log analysis software. It can filter log messages and select only the ones matching certain criteria. It can even convert the messages and restructure them to a predefined format, or parse the messages and segment them into different fields. But AxoSyslog cannot interpret and analyze the meaning behind the messages, or recognize patterns in the occurrence of different messages.
