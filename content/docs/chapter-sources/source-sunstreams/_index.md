Solaris uses its `STREAMS` framework to send messages to the `syslogd` process. Solaris 2.5.1 and above uses an IPC called *door* in addition to `STREAMS`, to confirm the delivery of a message. The `syslog-ng` application supports the IPC mechanism via the `door()` option (see below).

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

The `sun-streams()` driver must be enabled when the `syslog-ng` application is compiled (see `./configure --help`).

{{% /alert %}}

The `sun-streams()` driver has a single required argument specifying the `STREAMS` device to open, and the `door()` option. For the list of available optional parameters, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-sources/source-sunstreams/reference-source-sunstreams/_index.md" %}}.
