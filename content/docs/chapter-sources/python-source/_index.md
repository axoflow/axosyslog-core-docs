                self.post_message(msg)

## Methods of the python() source {#python-source-methods}

Server-style Python sources must be inherited from the `syslogng.LogSource` class, and must implement at least the `run` and `request_exit` methods. Multiple inheritance is allowed, but only for pure Python super classes.

You can implement your own event loop, or integrate the event loop of an external framework or library, for example, [KafkaConsumer](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaConsumer.html), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Twisted engine](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/), and so on.

To post messages, call `LogSource::post_message()` method in the `run` method.

{{% include-headless "chunk/python-method-init.md" %}}


## run(self) method (mandatory)

Use the **run** method to implement an event loop, or start a server framework or library. Create **LogMessage** instances in this method, and pass them to the log paths by calling **LogSource::post_message()**.

Currently, `run` stops permanently if an unhandled exception happens.

For details on parsing and posting messages, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-sources/python-source/python-source-logmessage/_index.md" %}}.



## request_exit(self) method (mandatory)

The {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} application calls this method when {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} is shut down or restarted. The `request_exit` method must shut down the event loop or framework, so the `run` method can return gracefully. If you use blocking operations within the `run()` method, use **request_exit()** to interrupt those operations and set an exit flag, otherwise {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} is not able to stop. Note that {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} calls the `request_exit` method from a thread different from the source thread.
