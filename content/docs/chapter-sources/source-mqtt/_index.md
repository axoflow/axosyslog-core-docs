From {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} version 3.35, you can use the `mqtt()` source to fetch messages from MQTT brokers.

The `mqtt()` source builds on the [MQTT protocol](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/mqtt-protocol/), and uses its [client](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/seven-best-mqtt-client-tools/) and [broker](https://www.hivemq.com/hivemq/mqtt-broker/) entities.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

The rest of this chapter and its sections build on your familiarity with the MQTT protocol, the concept of client and broker entities, and how these entities function within an MQTT system.

## Declaration:

```c
   source s_mqtt{
        mqtt(
            address("tcp://<hostname>:<port-number>")
            topic("<topic-name>")
        );
    };
```



## Example: Using the mqtt() source in your configuration

The following example illustrates an `mqtt()` source configured to fetch messages from the MQTT broker running on **localhost:4444** using the **test/test topic**, and send them to the **localhost:4445** address.

```c
   @version: 3.35
    @include "scl.conf"
    source s_mqtt {
        mqtt(
            address("tcp://localhost:4444")
            topic("test/test")
        );
    };
    destination d_network {
        network(
            "localhost"
            port(4445)
        );
    };
    log {
        source(s_mqtt);
        destination(d_network);;
    };
```
