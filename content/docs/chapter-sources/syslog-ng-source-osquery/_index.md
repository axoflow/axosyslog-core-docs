The [osquery](https://osquery.io) application allows you to ask questions about your machine using an SQL-like language. For example, you can query running processes, logged in users, installed packages and syslog messages as well. You can make queries on demand, and also schedule them to run regularly.

The `osquery()` source of {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} allows you read the results of periodical osquery queries (from the `/var/log/osquery/osqueryd.results.log` file) and automatically parse the messages (if you want to use {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} to [send log messages to osquery, read this blogpost](https://syslog-ng.com/blog/endpoint-visibility-and-monitoring-using-osquery-and-syslog-ng/)). For example, you can:

  - Create filters from the fields of the messages.

  - Limit which fields to store, or create additional fields (combine multiple fields into one field, and so on).

  - Send the messages to a central location, for example, to Elasticsearch, directly from {{% param "product.abbrev" %}}.

The {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} application automatically adds the `.osquery.` prefix to the name of the fields the extracted from the message.

The `osquery()` source is available in {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} version 3.10 and later.


## Prerequisites:

  - To use the `osquery()` driver, the `scl.conf` file must be included in your {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} configuration:
    
    ```c
        @include "scl.conf"
    
    ```

  - {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} must be compiled with JSON-support enabled.


The `osquery()` driver is actually a reusable configuration snippet configured to read the osquery log file using the `file()` driver, and process its JSON contents. For details on using or writing such configuration snippets, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-configuration-file/large-configs/config-blocks/_index.md" %}}. You can find the source of this configuration snippet on [GitHub](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/blob/master/scl/osquery/plugin.conf).


## Example: Using the osquery() driver with the default settings {#example-source-osquery}

The following {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} configuration sample uses the default settings of the driver, reading osquery result logs from the `/var/log/osquery/osqueryd.results.log` file, and writes the log messages generated from the traps into a file.

```c
   @version: 3.10
    @include "scl.conf"
    source s_osquery {
        osquery();
    };
    log {
        source(s_osquery);
        destination {
            file("/var/log/example.log");
        };
    };
```

Filter for messages related to loading Linux kernel modules:

```c
   @version: 3.10
    @include "scl.conf"
    source s_osquery {
        osquery();
    };
    log {
        source(s_osquery);
        filter f_modules {
            "${.osquery.name}" eq "pack_incident-response_kernel_modules"
        };
        destination {
            file("/var/log/example.log");
        };
    };
```



## Example: Using the osquery() driver with custom configuration

The following {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} configuration sample reads osquery result logs from the `/tmp/osquery_input.log` file, and writes the log messages generated from the traps into a file. Using the `format-json` template, the outgoing message will be a well-formed JSON message.


## Input message:

```c

## {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} configuration:

```c
   @version: 3.10
    @include "scl.conf"
    source s_osquery {
        osquery(
          file(/tmp/osquery_input.log)
          prefix(.osquery.)
        );
    };
    destination d_file {
        file(
          "/tmp/output.txt"
          template("$(format_json --key .osquery.*)\n")
        );
    };
    log {
      source(s_osquery);
      destination(d_file);
      flags(flow-control);
    };
```

## Outgoing message:

```c
