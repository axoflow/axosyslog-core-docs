This section describes how {{% param "product.name" %}} ({{% param "product.abbrev" %}}) supports the [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/).


## The working mechanism behind the Proxy Protocol

When using the Proxy Protocol during load balancing, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} detects the information behind connections connected to the load balancer, then parses the injected information and adds the following macros to every message the comes through the connection later on:

<span id="proxy-prot-adds-macros"></span>

  - `PROXY_SRCIP` (the source IP of the proxy)

  - `PROXY_SRCPORT` (the source port of the proxy)

  - `PROXY_DSTIP` (the destination IP of the proxy)

  - `PROXY_DSTPORT` (the destination port of the proxy)

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

Consider the following about macros and headers:

  - When the proxy protocol header is `PROXY UNKNOWN`, no additional macros are added.

  - When {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} cannot parse a proxy protocol header, the connection is closed:
    
    ```c
        [2020-11-20T17:33:22.189458] PROXY protocol header received; line='PROXYdsfj'
        [2020-11-20T17:33:22.189475] Error parsing PROXY protocol header;
        [2020-11-20T17:33:22.189517] Syslog connection closed; fd='13', client='AF_INET(127.0.0.1:51665)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:6666)'
        [2020-11-20T17:33:22.189546] Freeing PROXY protocol source driver; driver='0x7fffcba5bcf0'
        [2020-11-20T17:33:22.189600] Closing log transport fd; fd='13'
    
    ```

{{% /alert %}} {{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

Since the driver only implements version 1 of the protocol, it only supports TCP4 and TCP6 connections. TLS connections also supported.
