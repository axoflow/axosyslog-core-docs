title: AxoSyslog 4 documentation
---

AxoSyslog is a cloud-native syslog-ng distribution by [Axoflow](https://axoflow.com).

This documentation is based on the [syslog-ng Open Source Edition documentation](https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng-ose-guides/commit/2f4a52ee61d1ea9ad27cb4f3168b95408fddfdf2) for version 3.38 and is used in compliance with the terms of [The syslog-ng Open Source Edition Documentation License]({{< relref "/docs/documentation-license/_index.md" >}}).

In compliance with the above license, `syslog-ng` is used only to refer to the binary of the application, or in filenames, pathnames, and similar technical terms. For all other references, we use the AxoSyslog name.

This documentation is maintained by Axoflow. We are planning to update it to release 4.0.
