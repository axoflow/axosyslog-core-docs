Starting with {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} {{% conditional-text include-if="ose" %}}3.25{{% /conditional-text %}}, you can visualize the configuration of a running {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} instance using the `syslog-ng-ctl --export-config-graph` command. The command walks through the effective configuration, and exports it as a graph into a JSON structure.

The resulting JSON file can be converted into [DOT file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_\(graph_description_language\)) that visualization tools (for example, Graphviz) can use. The package includes a Python script to convert the exported JSON file into DOT format: `\<syslog-ng-installation-directory\>/contrib/scripts/config-graph-json-to-dot.py`

You can convert the DOT file into PNG or PDF format using external tools.
