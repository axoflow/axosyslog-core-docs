The `discord()` destination driver sends messages to [Discord](https://discord.com/) using [Discord Webhook](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook). For the list of available optional parameters, see Discord destination options.

Available in {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} version 3.33 and later.


## Declaration:

```c
   destination {
        discord(url("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/x/y"));
    };
```

By default the message sending is throttled to 5 message/sec, see [Discord: Rate Limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits#global-rate-limit). To change this, use the `throttle()` option.

To use this destination, the `scl.conf` file must be included in your {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} configuration:

```c
   @include "scl.conf"
```

The `discord()` driver is actually a reusable configuration snippet configured to send log messages using the `http()` driver. For details on using or writing such configuration snippets, see Reusing configuration blocks. You can find the source of this configuration snippet on GitHub.



## Prerequisites

To send messages to Discord, you must setup webhooks. For details, see: [Discord: Intro to Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).



## Example: Using the discord() driver {#example-destination-collectd}

The following example sends messages with custom avatar, and text-to-speech enabled.

```c
   @include "scl.conf"
    destination d_discord {
        discord(
            url("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/x/y")
            avatar-url("https://example.domain/any_image.png")
            username("$HOST-bot") # Custom bot name, accepts macros
            tts(true) # Text-to-Speech message
            template("${MSG:-[empty message]}") # Message to send, can't be empty
        );
    รณ}
```
