The `discord()` destination of {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} can directly post log messages to web services using the HTTP protocol. The `discord()` destination has the following options.

## response-action()

|          |                 |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Type:    | list            |
| Default: | N/A (see below) |

*Description:* Specifies what {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} does with the log message, based on the response code received from the HTTP server. If the server returns a status code beginning with 2 (for example, 200), {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} assumes the message was successfully sent. Otherwise, the action listed in the following table is applied. For status codes not listed in the following table, if the status code begins with 2 (for example, 299), {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} assumes the message was successfully sent. For other status codes, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} disconnects. The following actions are possible:

  - `disconnect`: Keep trying to resend the message indefinitely.

  - `drop`: Drop the message without trying to resend it.

  - `retry`: Retry sending the message for a maximum of `retries()` times (3 by default).

  - `success`: Assume the message was successfully sent.

```

To customize the action to take for a particular response code, use the following format: `response-action(\<response-code\> =\> \<action\>`. To customize multiple response code-action pairs, separate them with a comma, for example:

```c

``` 
 http(
    url("http://localhost:8080")
    response-action(418 => drop, 404 => retry)
);
```

```



{{% include-headless "chunk/option-destination-retries.md" %}}

To handle HTTP error responses, if the HTTP server returns 5xx codes, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} will attempt to resend messages until the number of attempts reaches `retries`. If the HTTP server returns 4xx codes, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} will drop the messages.



{{% include-headless "chunk/option-destination-template.md" %}}

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

Hazard of data loss\! Make sure to include a fallback value, as if the template gets resolved to an empty string, Discord rejects the message.
