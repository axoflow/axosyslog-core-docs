You can use **if {}**, **elif {}**, and **else {}** blocks to configure conditional expressions.


## Conditional expressions' format

Conditional expressions have two formats:

  - Explicit filter expression:
    
    ```c
    
        if (message('foo')) {
            parser { date-parser(); };
        } else {
            ...
        };
    
    ```
    
    This format only uses the filter expression in `if()`. If `if` does not contain `'foo'`, the `else` branch is taken.
    
    The `else{}` branch can be empty, you can use it to send the message to the default branch.

  - Condition embedded in the log path:
    
    ```c
    
        if {
            filter { message('foo')); };
            parser { date-parser(); };
        } else {
            ...
        };
    
    ```
    
    This format considers all filters and all parsers as the condition, combined. If the message contains `'foo'` and the `date-parser()` fails, the `else` branch is taken. Similarly, if the message does not contain `'foo'`, the `else` branch is taken.



## Using the if {} and else {} blocks in your configuration

You can copy-paste the following example and use it as a template for using the `if {}` and `else {}` blocks in your configuration.



## Example for using the if {} and else {} blocks in your configuration

The following configuration can be used as a template for using the `if {}` and `else {}` blocks:

```c

    log{
      source { example-msg-generator(num(1) template("...,STRING-TO-MATCH,..."));};
      source { example-msg-generator(num(1) template("...,NO-MATCH,..."));};
     
    if (message("STRING-TO-MATCH")) 
       {   
        destination { file(/dev/stdout template("matched: $MSG\n") persist-name("1")); };
       }
    else    
       {
        destination { file(/dev/stdout template("unmatched: $MSG\n") persist-name("2")); };
       };
    };

```

The configuration results in the following console printout:

```c

    matched: ...,STRING-TO-MATCH,...
    unmatched: ...,NO-MATCH,...

```


An alternative, less straightforward way to implement conditional evaluation is to use junctions. For details on junctions and channels, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-routing-filters/logpath/junctions/_index.md" %}}.
