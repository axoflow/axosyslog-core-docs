| Synopsis: | netmask(ipv4/mask) |

*Description:* Select only messages sent by a host whose IP address belongs to the specified IPv4 subnet. Note that this filter checks the IP address of the last-hop relay (the host that actually sent the message to {{% param "product.abbrev" %}}), not the contents of the `HOST` field of the message. You can use both the dot-decimal and the CIDR notation to specify the netmask. For example, `192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0` or `192.168.5.0/24`. To filter IPv6 addresses, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-routing-filters/filters/reference-filters/filter-netmask6/_index.md" %}}.
