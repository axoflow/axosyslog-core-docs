If the `reliable()` option is not set, by default a normal disk-buffer is created. To explicitly enable the normal disk-buffer option, use the `disk-buffer(reliable(no))` parameter in the destination. Use the normal disk-buffer option if you want a solution that is faster than the reliable disk-buffer option. In this case, the process will be less reliable and it is possible to lose logs in case of {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} crash. The filename of the normal disk-buffer file is the following: `\<syslog-ng path\>/var/syslog-ng-00000.qf`.


## Example: Example for using normal disk-based buffering

When using the disk-buffer plugin:

```c

    destination d_BSD {
        network("127.0.0.1"
            port(3333)
            disk-buffer(
                mem-buf-length(10000)
                disk-buf-size(2000000)
                reliable(no)
            )
        );
    }; 

```
