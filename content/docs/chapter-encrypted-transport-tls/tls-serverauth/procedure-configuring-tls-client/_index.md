## Purpose:

Complete the following steps on every `syslog-ng` client host. Examples are provided using both the legacy BSD-syslog protocol (using the `network()` driver) and the new IETF-syslog protocol standard (using the `syslog()` driver):



## Steps:

1.  Copy the CA certificate (for example, `cacert.pem`) of the Certificate Authority that issued the certificate of the `syslog-ng` server (or the self-signed certificate of the `syslog-ng` server) to the `syslog-ng` client hosts, for example, into the `/opt/syslog-ng/etc/syslog-ng/ca.d` directory.
    
    Issue the following command on the certificate: `openssl x509 -noout -hash -in cacert.pem` The result is a hash (for example, `6d2962a8`), a series of alphanumeric characters based on the Distinguished Name of the certificate.
    
    Issue the following command to create a symbolic link to the certificate that uses the hash returned by the previous command and the `.0` suffix.
    
    `ln -s cacert.pem 6d2962a8.0`

2.  Add a destination statement to the `syslog-ng` configuration file that uses the `tls( ca-dir(path_to_ca_directory) )` option and specify the directory using the CA certificate. The destination must use the `network()` or the `syslog()` destination driver, and the IP address and port parameters of the driver must point to the `syslog-ng` server.
    
    
    ## Example: A destination statement using TLS
    
    The following destination encrypts the log messages using TLS and sends them to the `6514/TCP` port of the `syslog-ng` server having the `10.1.2.3` IP address.
    
    ```c
        destination demo_tls_destination {
            network("10.1.2.3" port(6514)
                transport("tls")
                tls( ca_dir("/opt/syslog-ng/etc/syslog-ng/ca.d"))
            );
        };
    ```
    
    A similar statement using the IETF-syslog protocol and thus the `syslog()` driver:
    
    ```c
        destination demo_tls_syslog_destination {
            syslog("10.1.2.3" port(6514)
                                transport("tls")
                tls(ca_dir("/opt/syslog-ng/etc/syslog-ng/ca.d"))
            );
        };
    ```
    

3.  Include the destination created in Step 2 in a log statement.
    
    {{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
The encrypted connection between the server and the client fails if the `Common Name` or the `subject_alt_name` parameter of the server certificate does not contain the hostname or the IP address (as resolved from the `syslog-ng` clients and relays) of the server.
    
    Do not forget to update the certificate files when they expire.
    {{% /alert %}}
