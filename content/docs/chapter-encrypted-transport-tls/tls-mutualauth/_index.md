This section describes how to configure mutual authentication between the AxoSyslog server and the client. Configuring mutual authentication is similar to configuring TLS (for details, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-encrypted-transport-tls/tls-serverauth/_index.md" %}}), but the server verifies the identity of the client as well. Therefore, each client must have a certificate, and the server must have the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate of the clients. For the concepts of using TLS in `syslog-ng`, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-encrypted-transport-tls/concepts-tls/_index.md" %}}.
