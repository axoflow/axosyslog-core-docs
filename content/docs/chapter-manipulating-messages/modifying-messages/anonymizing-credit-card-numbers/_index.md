Log messages of banking and e-commerce applications might include credit card numbers (Primary Account Number or PAN). According to privacy best practices and the requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), PAN must be rendered unreadable. The {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} application uses a regular expression to detect credit card numbers, and provides two ways to accomplish this: you can either mask the credit card numbers, or replace them with a hash. To mask the credit card numbers, use the **credit-card-mask()** or the **credit-card-hash()** rewrite rules in a log path.


## Declaration:

```c

    @include "scl/rewrite/cc-mask.conf"
    
    rewrite {
        credit-card-mask(value("<message-field-to-process>"));
    };

```

By default, these rewrite rules process the MESSAGE part of the log message.



## credit-card-hash() {#credit-card-hash}

|           |                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synopsis: | credit-card-hash(value("\<message-field-to-process\>")) |

*Description:* Process the specified message field (by default, `${MESSAGE}`), and replace any credit card numbers (Primary Account Number or PAN) with a 16-character-long hash. This hash is generated by calculating the SHA-1 hash of the credit card number, selecting the first 64 bits of this hash, and representing this 64 bits in 16 characters.



## credit-card-mask() {#credit-card-mask}

|           |                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synopsis: | credit-card-mask(value("\<message-field-to-process\>")) |

*Description:* Process the specified message field (by default, `${MESSAGE}`), and replace the 7-12th character of any credit card numbers (Primary Account Number or PAN) with asterisks (**\***). For example, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} replaces the number `5542043004559005` with `554204\*\*\*\*\*\*9005`.
