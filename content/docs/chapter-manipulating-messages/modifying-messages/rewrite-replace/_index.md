To replace a part of the log message, you have to:

  - define a string or regular expression to find the text to replace

  - define a string to replace the original text (macros can be used as well)

  - select the field of the message that the rewrite rule should process

Substitution rules can operate on any soft macros, for example, MESSAGE, PROGRAM, or any user-defined macros created using parsers. You can also rewrite the structured-data fields of messages complying to the RFC5424 (IETF-syslog) message format.

Substitution rules use the following syntax:


## Declaration:

```c
   rewrite <name_of_the_rule> {
        subst(
            "<string or regular expression to find>",
            "<replacement string>", value(<field name>), flags()
        );
    };
```


The `type()` and `flags()` options are optional. The `type()` specifies the type of regular expression to use, while the `flags()` are the flags of the regular expressions. For details on regular expressions, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-manipulating-messages/regular-expressions/_index.md" %}}.

A single substitution rule can include multiple substitutions that are applied sequentially to the message. Note that rewriting rules must be included in the log statement to have any effect.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

For case-insensitive searches, add the `flags(ignore-case)` option. To replace every occurrence of the string, add `flags(global)` option. Note that the `store-matches` flag is automatically enabled in rewrite rules.

{{% /alert %}}


## Example: Using substitution rules {#example-rewrite-subst}

The following example replaces the `IP` in the text of the message with the string `IP-Address`.

```c
   rewrite r_rewrite_subst{
        subst("IP", "IP-Address", value("MESSAGE"));
    };
```

To replace every occurrence, use:

```c
   rewrite r_rewrite_subst{
        subst("IP", "IP-Address", value("MESSAGE"), flags("global"));
    };
```

Multiple substitution rules are applied sequentially. The following rules replace the first occurrence of the string `IP` with the string `IP-Addresses`.

```c
   rewrite r_rewrite_subst{
        subst("IP", "IP-Address", value("MESSAGE"));
        subst("Address", "Addresses", value("MESSAGE"));
    };
```
