Filters and substitution rewrite rules can use regular expressions. In regular expressions, the characters `()[].\*?+^$|\\` are used as special symbols. Depending on how you want to use these characters and which quotation mark you use, these characters must be used differently, as summarized below.

  - Strings between single quotes (`'string'`) are treated literally and are not interpreted at all, you do not have to escape special characters. For example, the output of `'\\x41'` is `\\x41` (characters as follows: backslash, `x`(letter), `4`(number), `1`(number)). This makes writing and reading regular expressions much more simple: it is recommended to use single quotes when writing regular expressions.

  - When enclosing strings between double-quotes (**"string"**), the string is interpreted and you have to escape special characters, that is, to precede them with a backslash (**\\**) character if they are meant literally. For example, the output of the `"\\x41"` is simply the letter `a`. Therefore special characters like `\\`(backslash) or `"`(quotation mark) must be escaped (`\\\\` and `\\"`). The following expressions are interpreted: `\\a`, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\t`, `\\v`. For example, the `\\$40` expression matches the `$40` string. Backslashes have to be escaped as well if they are meant literally, for example, the `\\\\d` expression matches the `\\d` string.
    
    {{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
If you use single quotes, you do not need to escape the backslash, for example, **match("\\\\.")** is equivalent to `match('\\.')`.
    {{% /alert %}}

  - Enclosing alphanumeric strings between double-quotes (**"string"**) is not necessary, you can just omit the double-quotes. for example, when writing filters, **match("sometext")** and **match(sometext)** will both match for the `sometext` string.
    
    {{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Only strings containing alphanumerical characters can be used without quotes or double quotes. If the string contains whitespace or any special characters (`()[].\*?+^$|\\` or `;:#`), you must use quotes or double quotes.
    
When using the `;:#` characters, you must use quotes or double quotes, but escaping them is not required.
    {{% /alert %}}

By default, all regular expressions are case sensitive. To disable the case sensitivity of the expression, add the **flags(ignore-case)** option to the regular expression.

```c
   filter demo_regexp_insensitive {
        host("system" flags(ignore-case));
    };
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Adding the `flags(ignore-case)` option to glob patterns does not disable case sensitivity.
{{% /alert %}}

The regular expressions can use up to 255 regexp matches (**${1} ... ${255}**), but only from the last filter and only if the **flags("store-matches")** flag was set for the filter. For case-insensitive searches, use the **flags("ignore-case")** option.
