![Processing logs in client mode](/images/figures/fig-client_mode01.png)

In client mode, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} collects the local logs generated by the host and forwards them through a network connection to the central {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} server or to a relay. Clients often also log the messages locally into files.
