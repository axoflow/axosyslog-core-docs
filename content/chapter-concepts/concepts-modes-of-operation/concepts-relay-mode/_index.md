![Processing logs in relay mode](fig-relay_mode01.png)

In relay mode, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} receives logs through the network from {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} clients and forwards them to the central {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} server using a network connection. Relays also log the messages from the relay host into a local file, or forward these messages to the central {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} server.
