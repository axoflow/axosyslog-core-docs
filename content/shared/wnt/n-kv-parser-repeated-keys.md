{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

If a log message contains the same key multiple times (for example, `key1=value1, key2=value2, key1=value3, key3=value4, key1=value5`), then {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} stores only the last (rightmost) value for the key. Using the previous example, {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} will store the following pairs: `key1=value5, key2=value2, key3=value4`.
