By default, the `throttle()` option is set to 1, because Slack has a 1 message/second limit on Webhooks. It can allow more message in short bursts, so you can set it to 0, if you only expect messages in a short period of time. For details, see the [Web API rate limiting in the Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits).
