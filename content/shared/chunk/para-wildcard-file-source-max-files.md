When using wildcards, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} monitors every matching file (up to the limit set in the `max-files()` option), and can receive new log messages from any of the files. However, monitoring (polling) many files (that is, more than ten) has a significant overhead and may affect performance. On Linux this overhead is not so significant, because {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} uses the inotify feature of the kernel. Set the **max-files()** option at least to the number of files you want to monitor. If the wildcard-file source matches more files than the value of the `max-files()` option, it is random which files will {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} actually monitor. The default value of `max-files()` is 100.
