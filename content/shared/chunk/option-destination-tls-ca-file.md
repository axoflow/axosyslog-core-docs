## ca-file()

|                  |           |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Accepted values: | File name |
| Default:         | empty     |

*Description:* Optional. The name of a file that contains a set of trusted CA certificates in PEM format. The {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} application uses the CA certificates in this file to validate the certificate of the peer.

Example format in configuration:

```c

    ca-file("/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt")

```


{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

The `ca-file()` option can be used together with the `ca-dir()` option, and it is relevant when `peer-verify()` is set to other than `no` or `optional-untrusted`.
