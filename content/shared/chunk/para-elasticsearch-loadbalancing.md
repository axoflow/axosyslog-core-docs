In version {{% conditional-text include-if="ose" %}}3.10{{% /conditional-text %}}{{% conditional-text include-if="pe" %}}7.0.3{{% /conditional-text %}} and newer, you can list multiple servers in HTTP and HTTPS mode in the `cluster-url()` and `server()` options. The {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} application will use these destination servers in load-balancing fashion. Note that load-balancing is handled by an external library (Jest), {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} does not have any direct influence on it.
