Names starting with a dot (for example, `.example`) are reserved for use by {{% productparam "abbrev" %}}. If you use such a macro name as the name of a parsed value, it will attempt to replace the original value of the macro (note that only soft macros can be overwritten, see {{% xref "/docs/chapter-manipulating-messages/customizing-message-format/macros-hard-vs-soft/_index.md" %}} for details). To avoid such problems, use a prefix when naming the parsed values, for example, `prefix(my-parsed-data.)`
