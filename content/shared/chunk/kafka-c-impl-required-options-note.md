{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

At least one of the <span class="userinput">config()</span> and the <span class="userinput">properties_file()</span> options is mandatory. While you can specify everything in the <span class="userinput">config()</span> option if you want, the <span class="userinput">properties-file()</span> is optional. If you have an option in both the <span class="userinput">config()</span> and the <span class="userinput">properties-file()</span> specified, the option specified later in the {{% productparam "abbrev" %}} configuration file will prevail.
