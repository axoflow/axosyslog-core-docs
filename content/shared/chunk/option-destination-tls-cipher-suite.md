| Accepted values: | Name of a cipher, or a colon-separated list                                  |
| Default:         | Depends on the OpenSSL version that {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} uses |

*Description:* Specifies the cipher, hash, and key-exchange algorithms used for the encryption, for example, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384`. The list of available algorithms depends on the version of OpenSSL used to compile {{% param "product.abbrev" %}}. To specify multiple ciphers, separate the cipher names with a colon, and enclose the list between double-quotes, for example:

```c

    cipher-suite("ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384")

```

For a list of available algorithms, execute the `openssl ciphers -v` command. The first column of the output contains the name of the algorithms to use in the `cipher-suite()` option, the second column specifies which encryption protocol uses the algorithm (for example, `TLSv1.2`). That way, the `cipher-suite()` also determines the encryption protocol used in the connection: to disable SSLv3, use an algorithm that is available only in TLSv1.2, and that both the client and the server supports. You can also specify the encryption protocols using [ssl-options()]({{< relref "/docs/chapter-encrypted-transport-tls/tlsoptions/_index.md" >}}).

You can also use the following command to automatically list only ciphers permitted in a specific encryption protocol, for example, `TLSv1.2`:

```c

    echo "cipher-suite(\"$(openssl ciphers -v | grep TLSv1.2 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs echo -n | sed 's/ /:/g' | sed -e 's/:$//')\")"

```

Note that starting with version {{% conditional-text include-if="ose" %}}3.10{{% /conditional-text %}}, when {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} receives TLS-encrypted connections, the order of ciphers set on the {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} server takes precedence over the client settings.
