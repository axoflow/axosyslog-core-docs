Starting with version 3.21, {{% param "product.name" %}} can directly publish log messages to the [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) message bus, where subscribers can access them.

As of {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} version 3.21, the new C implementation of the `kafka` destination is available. The new implementation uses the librdkafka client and has several advantages, such as scalability, more efficient memory usage and simpler setup. The options of this implementation are compatible with those of the old Java implementation.
