{{% param "product.abbrev" %}} can detect if the remote server of a network destination becomes inaccessible, and start sending messages to a secondary server. You can configure multiple failover servers, so if the secondary server becomes inaccessible as well, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} switches to the third server in the list, and so on. If there are no more failover servers left, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} returns to the beginning of a list and attempts to connect to the primary server.

The primary server is the address you provided in the destination driver configuration and it has a special role. {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} nominates this destination over the failover servers, and handles it as the primary address.

{{< include-headless "chunk/option-destination-description-failback.md" >}}

If {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} is restarted, it attempts to connect the primary server.

If {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} uses TLS-encryption to communicate with the remote server, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} checks the certificate of the failover server as well. The certificates of the failover servers should match their domain names or IP addresses â€” for details, see {{% xref "/chapter-encrypted-transport-tls/tls-serverauth/_index.md" %}}. Note that when mutual authentication is used, the {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} client sends the same certificate to every server.

The primary server and the failover servers must be accessible with the same communication method: it is not possible to use different destination drivers or options for the different servers.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

Client-side failover works only for TCP-based connections (including TLS-encrypted connections), that is, the `syslog()` and `network()` destination drivers (excluding UDP transport).

Client-side failover is not supported in the `sql()` driver, even though it may use a TCP connection to access a remote database.
