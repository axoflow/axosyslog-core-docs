Formats a dictionary into the [Common Event Format (CEF)](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/arcsight/arcsight-smartconnectors-8.3/cef-implementation-standard/Content/CEF/Chapter%201%20What%20is%20CEF.htm).

Usage: `${MESSAGE} = format_cef(my_dictionary);`

For example:

```json
my_dictionary = {"version":"0","device_vendor":" KasperskyLab ","device_product":"SecurityCenter","device_version":"13.2.0.1511","device_event_class_id":"KLPRCI_TaskState","name":"Completed successfully","agent_severity":"1"};

CEF:0| KasperskyLab |SecurityCenter|13.2.0.1511|KLPRCI_TaskState|Completed successfully|1|
```
