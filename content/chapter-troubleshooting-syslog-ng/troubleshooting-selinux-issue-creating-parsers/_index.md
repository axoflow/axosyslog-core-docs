If you are using a recent enough PCRE library, {{% param "product.abbrev" %}} will automatically use the JIT of the regexp engine, which will result in a similar error:

```shell
   setroubleshoot [21631 ] : SELinux is preventing <syslog-ng path> from using the execmem access on a process. (...)
    
    python [21631 ] : SELinux is preventing <syslog-ng path> from using the execmem access on a process.
```

To resolve this issue, switch off the PCRE JIT compile function by using the [disable-jit]({{< relref "/chapter-manipulating-messages/regular-expressions/reference-regexp-types/regexp-flags-options/regexp-flags-options-pcre/_index.md" >}}) `flags()` option in the given filter or rewrite rule of your configuration.
